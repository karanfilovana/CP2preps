    <h2>Hello!</h2>
    <p style="background-color:rgba(146, 77, 179, 0.4);">This site is made by Ana Karanfilova, a first year student at UP Famnit and will definitely have typos because it’s very early in the morning.
	This is a project for Computer Practicum 2 course where we have to show out HTML skills. Skills i am yet to gain. It will be fun. I don't know what to write.
	Basic info: I can speak two languages and am learning a third one, but slowly because I am lazy and college is demanding. To think i have as more work as my little brother and he has
	twice as much school subjects. What else? I like listening to music, watching movies etc...
	Favorite food: anything chocolate. Favorite animal: can't choose and that is that i this i hit the mark b ut just in case.
