<h2>IRONIC - <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alanis_Morissette" target="_blank">
<span style="color:gray;">Alanis Morissette</span></a></h2>
<div class="quote"><pre><q>An old man turned 98
He won the lottery and died the next day
It's a black fly in your Chardonnay
It's a death row pardon two minutes too late
And isn't it ironic, don't you think?</q>
	             -Ironic, A. Morissette</pre></div>

<p>It was released in February 1996 as the third single from her third studio album, Jagged Little Pill (1995). It was written by Morissette and Glen Ballard, and was produced by him.  The lyrics present several situations that are described as "ironic"; this has led to debate as to whether any of these actually match the accepted meaning of irony. For me the interesting part is how people understand what is said even though it isn't worded correctly according to experts. </p>

<h2 style="color:rgba(255, 99, 71, 1);">Rock</h2>
<p>Rock music is a broad genre of popular music that originated as "rock and roll" in the United States in the late 1940s and early 1950s, 
developing into a range of different styles in the mid-1960s and later, particularly in the United States and the United Kingdom.
It has its roots in 1940s and 1950s rock and roll, a style that drew directly from the black musical genres of blues, rhythm and blues, and from country music. 
Rock music also drew strongly from a number of other genres such as electric blues and folk, and incorporated influences from jazz, classical, and other musical styles. 
For instrumentation, rock has centered on the electric guitar, usually as part of a rock group with electric bass, drums, and one or more singers. 
Usually, rock is song-based music with a 4 4 time signature using a verseâ€“chorus form, but the genre has become extremely diverse. 
Like pop music, lyrics often stress romantic love but also address a wide variety of other themes that are frequently social or political.</p>
